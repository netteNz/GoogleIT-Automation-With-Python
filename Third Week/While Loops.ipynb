    "# Common Pitfalls with Variable Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll want to watch out for a common mistake: forgetting to initialize variables. If you try to use a variable without first initializing it, you'll run into a **NameError**. This is the Python interpreter catching the mistake and telling you that youâ€™re using an undefined variable. The fix is pretty simple: initialize the variable by assigning the variable a value before you use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common mistake to watch out for that can be a little trickier to spot is forgetting to initialize variables with the correct value. If you use a variable earlier in your code and then reuse it later in a loop without first setting the value to something you want, your code may wind up doing something you didn't expect. Don't forget to initialize your variables before using them!"

This can happen when the condition being evaluated in a *while* loop doesn't change. Pay close attention to your variables and what possible values they can take. Think about unexpected values, like zero.\n",
