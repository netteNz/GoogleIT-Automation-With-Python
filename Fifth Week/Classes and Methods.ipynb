    "## What Is a Method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling methods on objects executes functions that operate on attributes of a specific instance of the class. This means that calling a method on a list, for example, only modifies that instance of a list, and not all lists globally. We can define methods within a class by creating functions inside the class definition. These instance methods can take a parameter called **self** which represents the instance the method is being executed on. This will allow you to access attributes of the instance using dot notation, like **self.name**, which will access the name attribute of that specific instance of the class object. When you have variables that contain different values for different instances, these are called instance variables."

    "Instead of creating classes with empty or default values, we can set these values when we create the instance. This ensures that we don't miss an important value and avoids a lot of unnecessary lines of code. To do this, we use a special method called a **constructor**. Below is an example of an Apple class with a constructor method defined.\n",

    "```\n",
    "When you call the name of a class, the constructor of that class is called. This constructor method is always named **__init__**. You might remember that special methods start and end with two underscore characters. In our example above, the constructor method takes the self variable, which represents the instance, as well as color and flavor parameters. These parameters are then used by the constructor method to set the values for the current instance. So we can now create a new instance of the Apple class and set the color and flavor values all in go:\n",

    "In addition to the **__init__** constructor special method, there is also the **__str__** special method. This method allows us to define how an instance of an object will be printed when it’s passed to the print() function. If an object doesn’t have this special method defined, it will wind up using the default representation, which will print the position of the object in memory. Not super useful. Here is our Apple class, with the **__str__** method added:\n",
    "\n",

    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return \"This apple is {} and its flavor is {}\".format(self.color, self.flavor)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, when we pass an Apple object to the print function, we get a nice formatted string:\n",
