    "# Classes and Methods Cheat Sheet\n",
    "In the past few videos, we’ve seen how to define classes and methods in Python. Here, you’ll find a run-down of everything we’ve covered, so you can refer to it whenever you need a refresher.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining classes and methods\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def ClassName:\n",
    "    def method_name(self, other_parameters):\n",
    "        body_of_method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classes and Instances\n",
    "- Classes define the behavior of all instances of a specific class.\n",
    "- Each variable of a specific class is an instance or object.\n",
    "- Objects can have attributes, which store information about the object.\n",
    "- You can make objects do work by calling their methods.\n",
    "- The first parameter of the methods (self) represents the current instance.\n",
    "- Methods are just like functions, but they can only be used through a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Special Methods\n",
    "- Special methods start and end with __.\n",
    "- Special methods have specific names, like __init__ for the constructors or __str__ for the conversion to string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Documenting classes, methods and functions\n",
    "- You can add documentation to classes, methods, and functions by using docstrings right after the definition. Like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Documentation for the class.\"\"\"\n",
    "    def method_name(self, other_parameters):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Documentation for the method.\"\"\"\n",
    "        body_of_method\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Documentation for the function.\"\"\"\n",
    "        body_of_function\n",
    "```"
